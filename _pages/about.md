I am a physician scientist dedicated to harness the power of technology to improve outcomes for cancer patients.

My journey began at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich, where I graduated from medical school. I then advanced my research expertise with a medical doctoral thesis (Dr. med.) in cancer immunology at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), under [Prof. Thorsten Mempel](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/ciid/research-labs/thorsten-mempel) at the [Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/ciid), where I discovered my fascination for single-cell technologies.

Pursuing an interest in computational biology, I completed an MPhil at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My thesis focused on computational oncology, conducted at the [Wu Lab](https://wulab.dfci.harvard.edu/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

Currently, I am working towards a PhD at [Helmholtz Center Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/) and [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/), in the group of [Prof. Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab). My research intersects biomedical and clinical data with machine learning. Concurrently, I am preparing for a medical residency in hematology and oncology, aiming to integrate clinical practice with my research endeavors.
